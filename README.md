# Objective : 
### The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates home prices based on various features. This can assist potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.
# Dataset :
### The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and contained a comprehensive collection of home sales data. Link of the Dataset = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data/data"
# Data Preprocessing :
	1) Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values using mean/mode for numerical/categorical features respectively.
	2) Feature Engineering: Created new features like Age of the house, Total Bathrooms, and others to capture more information.
	3) Encoding Categorical Variables: Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
	4) Scaling: Normalized numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model training.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
	1) Visualization: Used plots (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to understand feature distributions and relationships with home prices.
	2) Correlation Analysis: Identified highly correlated features to target variable (Sale Price) and among independent variables.
# Model Building :
## Multiple regression algorithms were tested to find the best model, including :
		1) Linear Regression: Basic approach to establish a baseline
		2) Lasso Regression: short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, 
  		   is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization technique.
		3) Decision Tree Regressor: Captured non-linear relationships but prone to overfitting.
# Model Evaluation :
### Cross-Validation : Used k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.
# Results :
### The Linear Regressor provided the best performance with the lowest RMSE on the validation set, indicating its effectiveness in predicting home prices.
# Conclusion : 
### The project successfully developed a machine learning model capable of predicting home prices with high accuracy. The Linear Regression model, in particular, demonstrated excellent performance, making it a valuable tool for stakeholders in the real estate market.

# Technologies Used : 
	    1) Python
        2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
        3) Matplotlib for data visualization
        4) Sklearn for model building
        5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
        6) Python flask for http server
        7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
